      $scope.info6 ="Before you hold up a Mystery Skype/Hangout class make sure you get students prepared. Here are some tips to help you get them ready : \r\n 1- Get your students to fact check information they will include in their answers. They can use the web for this purpose and look for things such as : information about geographical location where they live, number of population, historical monuments, languages spoken, economic mainstayâ€¦etc. \r\n 2- Connecting with classes in different regions entails knowing the time zone differences between the two locations. To help you overcome this time problem you can use these tools : World Clock- Online Conversion-Time and Date \r\n 3-Assign jobs to students : For students to better benefit from the time they spend communicating with the guest  class, you need to assign each one of them a task to carry out. Some of these tasks include : greeters ( these are students who will greet the guest class when they first connect), askers ( these are students who will pose questions), note takers ( these are the ones entrusted with taking notes), photographers ( they take pictures during the call). For a list of the different tasks  to assign to your students, check out this resource."
